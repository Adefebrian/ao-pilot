# AR.IO Network AO Experiments

## ðŸš€ Welcome

Welcome to the AR.IO Network AO Experiments repository! This space is dedicated to our ongoing experiments with the AR.IO Network protocols, particularly focused on integrating the powerful Arweave Name System (ArNS) into the AO Supercomputer. Here, we explore vital processes driving the ArNS-AO Registry, including a lightweight Name Resolver and an Arweave Name Token implementation.

## ðŸ“¦ What's Inside

Discover the core components of this repository:

- **`src/arns-registry.lua`**: Core process code for the Arweave Name System Registry.
- **`src/arns-resolver.lua`**: Lightweight resolver process for efficient name records retrieval.
- **`src/ant-base.lua`**: Base Arweave Name Token specification.
- **`src/ant.lua`**: Extended Arweave Name Token specification with added management controls.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Integrate the power of ArNS into your AOS terminal seamlessly:

```sh
.load-blueprint arns
```
For a comprehensive guide on leveraging the ArNS Resolver and effectively mapping an AO Process to the ArNS Registry, visit the AR.IO Docs portal. Dive into step-by-step instructions, best practices, and resources to seamlessly integrate ArNS functionalities into your Arweave applications.
